\section*{Write models 1 and 2 as a system of two first-order PDEs (in time) as discussed in exercise \textbf{SC1}}
We can rewrite $u_{tt} = u_{xxx}$ as;
$$
\begin{cases}
v = u_t\\
v_t = u_{xxx}
\end{cases}
$$

\section*{Describe and implement a boundary-value (BV) technique for both models. For a description of BV we refer to the documents on the web page of this course. Note that different choices can be made for the time-integration part of BV and also for its (extra) final condition at $t=T$}
We have to make our PDEs discrete. We use leapfrog for our time integration and we use the $\hot{(\dx)^2}$ space discretization we derived in SC1;
$$u_t \approx \frac{\uinp - \uinm}{2\dt} \;\;\;\;\mathrm{and}\;\;\;\;v_t \approx \frac{\vinp - \vinm}{2\dt}$$
$$u_{xxx} \approx \frac{-\half{u_{i-2}^n}+\uimn-\uipn+\half{u_{i+2}^n}}{(\dx)^3}$$

We want to construct a system of linear equations that solves our PDE. The equations above can be used to construct linear constraints: we want to enforce that $v=u_t$ and $v_t=u_{xxx}$;
$$v = u_t \approx \frac{\uinp - \uinm}{2\dt}$$
\begin{equation}
\uinp-2\dt\vin-\uinm = 0
\label{eq:uin}
\end{equation}
And similarly:
$$\frac{\vinp - \vinm}{2\dt} \approx v_t = u_{xxx} \approx \frac{-\half{u_{i-2}^n}+\uimn-\uipn+\half{u_{i+2}^n}}{(\dx)^3}$$
\begin{equation}
\vinp-\frac{2\dt}{(\dx)^3}\(-\half{u_{i-2}^n}+\uimn-\uipn+\half{u_{i+2}^n}\)-\vinm = 0
\label{eq:vin}
\end{equation}
In this system we see $\uin$ and $\vin$ as our variables. Let $T = N\dt$, then $n\in\{0,1,\dots,N\}$. Similarly we choose $x_M=x_{max}$ and $x_0=x_{min}$, with $m \in \{0,1,\dots,M-1\}$. We will handle boundary conditions in the space direction and our choice of $\dx$ separately for the different models.
Notice that our constraints are invalid if they contain non-existent variables such as $u_i^{N+1}$, $v_i^{N+1}$, $u_i^{-1}$ or $v_i^{-1}$. We do not use such invalid constraints, but add boundary conditions for $n=0$ and $n=N$ instead:
\begin{equation}
u_i^0 = u(x_i, 0)
\label{eq:ui0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
u_i^N = u(x_i, T)
\label{eq:uiN}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
v_i^0 = v(x_i, 0)
\label{eq:vi0}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
v_i^N = v(x_i, T)
\label{eq:viN}
\end{equation}
The functions $u_0$, $v_0$ (the initial conditions)  and $u_T$, $v_T$ (the final conditions) are different functions for model 1 and model 2.
If all boundary conditions are chosen correctly, the number of constraints is exactly equal to the number of variables. We will write the system in the standard form, $A w = b$, where $A$ is a (known) matrix with all constraints, $b$ is a (known) vector with all the constants from the constraints, and $w$ the (unknown) vector that will contain our solution.

Let $w=(w^0, w^1, \dots w^N)^T$, where $w^n=(w_0^n,w_1^n,\dots,w_{M-1}^n)$ (we use $w_M^n$ and $w_{-1}^n$ for our boundary conditions) and $w_i^n = (\uin,\vin)$. If $w$ is implemented as a ``flat'' array, we have $\uin$ on (1-based) index $n2M+\hat i 2+1$ and $\vin$ on (1-based) index $n2M+\hat i 2+2$, where $\hat i = (i+M)\mod M$ (periodic boundary conditions).% The correctness of these formulas can be seen as follows; $u_0^0$ has index 1. $u_{i+1}^n$ has an index that is 
We will place our constraints on the rows of $A$. For bookkeeping, we can assign a row to every constraint using the indexing we used for $\uin$ and $\vin$; we will put constraint \eqref{eq:uin} on row ``$\uin$'' (also known as row $n2M+\hat i 2+1$) and constraint \eqref{eq:vin} on row ``$\vin$'' (also known as row $n2M+\hat i 2+2$). The constraints that follow from the boundary-conditions, \eqref{eq:ui0}, \eqref{eq:uiN}, \eqref{eq:vi0} and \eqref{eq:viN} are placed similarly, on rows ``$u_i^0$'', ``$u_i^N$'', ``$v_i^0$'' and ``$v_i^N$'' respectively. These constraints contain constants that have to be placed in $b$. Notice that there is exactly one constraint for every variable, so we are sure that our system is not underdetermined or overdetermined. Our implementation (in Octave) of the BV-method can be found in appendix A.

\subsection*{Model 1}
For Model 1 we use $\dx = 1/M$, so $M\dx=1$. We have periodic boundary conditions, so $x_0 = x_{min} = x_{max} = x_M$, so $w_M^n = w_0^n$, which is why we do not need to use $u(1, t)$ and $v(1, t)$ explicitly (remember that $i \leq M-1$). Our initial condition is $u(x, 0) = \sin(2\pi x)$ and $v(x, 0) = 0$. For the final condition on $u$ we use the exact solution given, and for $v$ we use its derivative; 
$$u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-2 \pi ^{3/2} t} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi  \left(\sqrt{\pi } t+x\right)\right)-e^{4 \pi ^{3/2} t} \sin \left(2 \pi ^{3/2} t-2 \pi  x\right)\right)$$
$$v(x,t) = \pi ^{3/2} e^{-2 \pi ^{3/2} t} \left(-\sin \left(2 \pi  \left(\sqrt{\pi } t+x\right)\right)+\cos \left(2 \pi  \left(\sqrt{\pi } t+x\right)\right)-e^{4 \pi ^{3/2} t} \left(\sin \left(2 \pi ^{3/2} t-2 \pi  x\right)+\cos \left(2 \pi ^{3/2} t-2 \pi  x\right)\right)\right)$$

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Model 2}
This time $u(x, 0) = e^{-3(x-2)^2}$ and $v_0$ is set to $D^{3/2}_xu_0(x)$, the Caputo Fractional Derivative of order $3/2$ of $u_0$. The integral given ($\frac{1}{\Gamma(1/2)}\int_0^x{\frac{u''_0(\hat x)}{\sqrt{x-\hat x}}d\hat x}$) cannot be integrated analytically, but can be approximated numerically; we used the method provided on the web page to do this. Plots of the initial conditions on $u$ and $v$ can be seen in figure \ref{fig:2init}. The final condition on $u$ and $v$ are not known analytically now. Let us take a look at the equations to find an estimate.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{2init.png}
\caption{The initial conditions for model 2}
\label{fig:2init}
\end{figure}
We do still have:
$$u_{tt} = u_{xxx}$$
And at $t=0$ we have $u_t = v = D^{3/2}_x u$, and $v_t = u_{tt} = u_{xxx} = D^{3/2}_x(D^{3/2}_x u) = D^{3/2}_x v$;
So as long $v = D^{3/2}_x u$ is satisfied we can write our ODEs as;
$$
\begin{cases}
u_t = D^{3/2}_x u\\
v_t = D^{3/2}_x v\\
\end{cases}
$$
%Now we will show that the equation $v = D^{3/2}_x u$ at $t=0$ will hold for other values of $t$ as well.%TODO: does this actually hold?
%$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(v - D^{3/2}_x u) = v_t - D^{3/2}_x v = u_{xxx} - D^{3/2}_x v$

Under these circumstances we expect $u$ and $v$ to behave ``independently'' according to the same ODE. As a result, we expect that they will keep satisfying these equations for $t\not = 0$ as well. The dynamics should be somewhere in between the advection ($u_t = u_{x}$) and heat ($u_t = u_{xx}$) equation. In the advection equation we expect the initial condition to move to the $-x$ direction with constant speed. In the heat equation we expect a lot of diffusion. Hence for our ``hybrid'' ODE we qualitatively expect some damped movement in the $-x$ direction. If the damping goes fast enough, the ``mass'' in the initial condition will be spread more evenly at $t = 1$. Hence choosing $v = u = 0$ at $t = 1$ seems reasonable (we will verify this choice with a numerical experiment). We expect that the (non-zero part of the) solution will stay away from $x=-5$ and $x=8$ since the initial value is significantly bigger than $0$ for $x\in [0, 6]$ only, leaving a size $5$ buffer to the left and a size $2$ buffer to the right. Hence we choose $v(-5, t) = v(8, t) = 0$. 

Now for our choice of $\dx$. We have $u = v = 0$ for $x = -5$ and $x = 8$, so we want $x_0 = -5 + \dx$ and $x_{M-1} = 8 - \dx$. So we set $x = -5 + (i+1)\dx$ with $\dx = \frac{13}{M+1}$.

\section*{Perform numerical experiments with the BV-technique applied to both models. Illustrate your report with a couple of plots and tables}
\subsection*{Model 1}
In figure \ref{fig:spy}, the position of non-zero elements in our matrix $A$ can be seen.
We tested our method for $N = 10$ and $M = 100$. See figure \ref{fig:ucomp1} through \ref{fig:verr1} for a comparison of the exact solution and the values found with the BV-technique. Our implementation gives a reasonable estimation of $u$ and $v$, but a high accuracy is not achieved, especially for the high complexity of the BV-method. To obtain these results we had to solve a $2200\times2200$ ($2200 = 2*M*(N+1)$) linear system, which took about 30 seconds. During this calculation, Octave reported that our matrix $A$, was likely singular. We checked this by using $rank$, and found out that $A$ has $rank$ $2198$. After a while I realised that this is due to the characteristic of Leapfrog and our choice of $N$: $u$ on odd timesteps and $v$ on even timesteps are independent of $u$ on even timesteps and $v$ on odd timesteps. By choosing $N = 10$, our initial condition and final condition are both constraints on $u$ and $v$ in an even timestep, causing our matrix to be singular, and allowing invalid values for $u$ and $v$ on odd timesteps. After solving this problem by choosing $N$ odd, we have had far more accurate results and faster calculation;%TODO: explain properly
We have solved a system with $N = 9$ and $M = 100$, this took about $0.3$ seconds. The absolute error in $u$ improved by approximately a factor 3. See figure \ref{fig:uerr1small} and \ref{fig:verr1small}.
We have solved a system with $N = 201$ and $M = 200$, this took about $30$ seconds. See figure \ref{fig:uerr1big} and \ref{fig:verr1big} for the errors.

\subsection*{Model 2}
As mentioned before we chose our boundary values to be zero, because low values are to be expected after a lot of smoothing has occurred. To numerically verify that the given model will indeed be damped (near zero) at $t=1$, we first ran our simulation until $t=10$. The results can be seen in figure \ref{fig:uvdamp}. We noticed small oscillations between even and odd timesteps in both $u$ and $v$, although they are not as bad as we observed for even values of $N$. To get a rough estimate of the amplitude of these oscillations, we compared the linear average of two adjacent odd timesteps in $u$ with the even timestep in between them. The result can be seen in figure \ref{fig:oscsize}. Linear interpolation is not perfect, hence we can see that the curvature of $u$ some effect on this plot; see the small wave near $t=x=0$ (so $i \approx 100$ and $n = 0$), with amplitude about $0.01$. We can also see a big wave at $t=10$ with amplitude $0.05$, where $u$ appears to be nice and flat; this is an estimate of the size of the oscillations in $u$.
